### or: How to get from a dream to 19 three-months-scholarships - in under 3 months.

A Summer of Code sponsoring 10 teams of
[students from all over the world](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students)
working on Open Source projects full-time for three months? - Hell, yes!

[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign)
(RGSoC) does exactly this: support women who fell in love with programming at e.g. a
[Rails Girls Workshop](http://railsgirls.com) and kept on coding.

[Travis](http://travis-ci.org) has about been rooted in the community very
deeply, so we've decided to support this truly wonderful program \- with all
our hearts.

Well ... that's actually not even the full truth:

Not just with our hearts! Travis CI GmbH is going to found [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org),
an non-profit organization aiming to support cool initiatives and projects
just like this one. (That's another, longer story and we'll tell you all about
here soon!)

[Sven](https://twitter.com/svenfuchs) has since then worked full-hearted and
full-time for RGSoC and getting Travis Foundation started, and in order to make
sure we have the capacities to really get stuff done, I, [Anika](https://twitter.com/langziehohr),
have come on board with Travis in June (whohoo! Another great story to blog about soon!).

We are supporting the Rails Girls Summer of Code team where
we can and make sure everything runs smoothly. Travis-style: make amazing stuff happen :)

### A crazy journey: raising 81k in two weeks

The whole idea was born in March, at a Rails Girls Berlin coaches & organizers
meeting: Appearantly whenever there is cake and coffee around magic starts happening ;)

RGSoC does not only provide [10 teams](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students)
the chance to really get deeper into coding and get in touch with our amazing
Open Source community. It also adds a more long-term goal to the Rails Girls
movement. From now on students will start planning ahead and are even more
motivated to keep on learning so they can be well prepared for next year's
Summer of Code!

Being the first Rails Girls students who make a meaningful contribution to
projects like Rails, Sinatra, Bundler, Spree ... We think they will become
amazing role models for others to look up to!

Because we all were so fascinated by this idea Sven gave a lightning talk at a
[Rails Girls workshop](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/2013/04/01/review-follow-up-workshop-march-2013)
at [Wooga](http://wooga.com) in late March. The idea immediately spread like
wildfire in the community. After that a whole new team formed, rolled up
their sleeves and started to make this happen.

And the work has paid off:

* Over 140 students applied [from all over the world](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students).
* Over 280 people & companies donated for the campaing.
* [Sponsorships from amazing companies](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign)
  have been secured. Amongst them community heroes like
  [GitHub](http://github.com),
  [37signals](http://37signals.com),
  [Tilde](http://tilde.io),
  [Google Open Source] (https://developers.google.com/open-source/)
  [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) ...
* We raised 80,0000 in just two weeks.
* We could accept 19 students so far. That's 9 more than our original goal which we thought was super ambitious!
* We will keep the campaign open, just in case we might be able to add some
  late extra seats (so you could still come on board as a sponsor!).

**Wow. Just ... wow. Wowwowow ...**

Who would have thought that the initial idea could explode into such an amazing
project this quickly, supported by so much love and effort!

With RGSoC we are super proud to support a first, fantastic
project with Travis Foundation.

And unlike the shadows under our eyes: Rails Girls Summer of Code looks really,
really good!
