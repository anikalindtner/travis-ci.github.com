### Or: How to get from a dream to 19 sponsored scholarships in under 3 months.

A Summer of Code sponsoring 10 teams of
[students from all over the world](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students)
working on Open Source projects full-time for three months. Sounds like a great idea? Why of course it does!

That's the idea of [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign), to support women who fell in love with programming, for instance at 
a [Rails Girls Workshop](http://railsgirls.com) workshop, and who kept on coding for the joy of it.

As [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) has always been deeply rooted in the community, supporting this project with all our hearts has been a no-brainer for us!

[Sven](https://twitter.com/svenfuchs) rolled up his sleeves and has been working on getting Rails Girls Summer of Code off the ground. I, [Anika](https://twitter.com/langziehohr), joined the Travis CI team in June to help organize the Summer of Code.

### What a crazy journey: raising $81,000 for a great cause in just about two weeks

The idea was born in March, at a meeting of Rails Girls Berlin coaches and organizers. Apparantly whenever there is cake and coffee around magic starts happening ;)

Rails Girls Summer of Code provides [10 sponsored teams and 8 volunteering Teams](http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams)
with the chance to dive deeper into coding and to get in touch with the amazing
Open Source community. On top of that it gives the Rails Girls movement a longer-term goal of supporting women in technology.

From now on students can start planning ahead and keep on learning so they'll be well prepared for next year's Summer of Code!

Being the first Rails Girls students who make a meaningful contribution to projects like Rails, Sinatra, Bundler, Spree and others we think they'll lead the way for other women to follow suit and contribute actively to open source projects and find a career in software development.

Because we were all so fascinated by this idea, Sven gave a lightning talk at a
[Rails Girls workshop](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/2013/04/01/review-follow-up-workshop-march-2013)
at [Wooga](http://wooga.com) in late March. The idea immediately spread like wildfire. A whole new team formed, rolled up their sleeves and started to make this happen.

And the work has paid off:

* Over 140 students applied [from all over the world](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students).
* Over 280 people & companies donated for the campaign.
* [Sponsorships from amazing companies](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign)
  have sponsored the program. Amongst them community heroes like
  [GitHub](http://github.com),
  [37signals](http://37signals.com),
  [Tilde](http://tilde.io),
  [Google Open Source] (https://developers.google.com/open-source/)
  [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) ...
* We raised $80,0000 in the first two weeks alone.
* We were able to accept 19 students into the program so far. That's 9 more than our original goal which we thought was super ambitious already!
* We managed to organize for the students no less than [49 free tickets to some of the best Ruby conferences](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/the-big-conferenc-raffle-winners/) on 3 different continents 

### Drumroll: Travis Foundation

Who would have thought that the initial idea could explode into such an amazing
project this quickly, supported by so much love and effort!

To make even more of these wonderful initiatives and projects happen  - Travis CI is setting up and sponsoring the [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org), an non-profit organization aiming for diversity in tech, and to work hard on making open source an even better place. (That's another, longer story and we'll tell you all about here soon!)

Travis Foundation is very proud to support Rails Girls Summer of Code as its first, fantastic project.

It's only been a month since Rails Girls Summer of Code started. Since then, it has already grown into a successful and widely loved project!
